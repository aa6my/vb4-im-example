# vb4-im-example

This is an archived copy of my earliest open source project, written when I was 16. This was an example of how one might go about building a centralized instant messenger in Visual Basic 4. The intent was to demonstrate TCP/IP coding in VB4.

Stop laughing. It isn't that funny. This was cutting edge stuff back in the day! It had almost fifty thousand downloads from it's original host. I can see you're super impressed.

Anyway, I have no idea if this would compile anymore. I imagine not. I wouldn't recommend it, in any case.

Stop laughing.
